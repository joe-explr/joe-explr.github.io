## Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Joseph, a Backend Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable distributed systems. I've created this space to share my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in the world of software engineering.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find articles about:

- **Distributed Systems**: Deep dives into consensus algorithms, data replication, and building fault-tolerant systems
- **Backend Engineering**: Best practices for building APIs, microservices architecture, and system design
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Experiences with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines
- **Learning Journey**: My experiences as a graduate student at Stony Brook University

## My Background

I have 4+ years of experience working as a Backend Software Engineer, most recently at:
- **Sigmoid Analytics** - Building real-time data processing pipelines
- **Oracle Cerner** - Developing healthcare software serving thousands of users

Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, diving deeper into systems programming, compilers, and distributed computing.
