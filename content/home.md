I build performance-critical systems for large-scale compute, spanning accelerator virtualization, distributed communication, and OS-level infrastructure. My work focuses on making complex systems deterministic, observable, and efficient. I also bring production experience designing latency-sensitive backend services at scale. Currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Stony Brook University.
